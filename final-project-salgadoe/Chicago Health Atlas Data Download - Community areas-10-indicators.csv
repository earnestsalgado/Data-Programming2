(Definition),,,,,,"Years of productive life lost per 100,000 population","Income in the past 12 months.","The Hardship Index is a composite score reflecting hardship in the community (higher values indicate greater hardship). It incorporates unemployment, age dependency, education, per capita income, crowded housing, and poverty into a single score that allows comparison between geographies. It is highly correlated with other measures of economic hardship, such as labor force statistics, and with poor health outcomes. See technical notes for details.","The Economic Diversity Index measures the probability that any two residents of an area, chosen at random, belong to different family income levels, measured as multiples of the Federal Poverty Level. A score of 0 represents a perfectly homogenous community; the higher the score, the more economically diverse the area. The highest possible score is 0.833, not 1.","Percentage of households that have children present and are headed by a single parent (mother or father), with no partner present.","Percent of residents 16 and older in the civilian labor force who are actively seeking employment.","Percent of residents in families that are in poverty (below the Federal Poverty Level).","Average population over the time period.","Number of people who died due to suicide.","The average number of years a person may expect to live."
